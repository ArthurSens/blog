I don't really know what to write here, I'm not even certain why I'm writing to be honest.

What would you do if you had only a few days left to live and you were completely aware of the situation? I had a call with a friend today, because of a few things happening in my life, the conversation went that way.

I have no fucking clue... I few hours have passed since the call and I'm still thinking about it. Would I tell people? I'm not really sure, maybe one or two people I guess. Would I spend all my money with travels? Most definitely yes. Would I reflect on what I did with my life, would I regret the way I lived, would I think that I could have done things differently, would I be sorry for myself and complain to an imaginary entity that it's not fair? I want to say no, but the reality is that I'm not trained for this kind of situation... I guess nobody is...

Have you folks seen the movie "Everything, Everywhere, All at once"? That movie is a fucking masterpiece, I won't write a summary here, you'll need to see for yourself, but it just hits me differently. One of my favorite scenes is when the mother and the daugther go to an universe where life couldn't form and they are just two rocks. The movie is 100% COMPLETE CHAOS, except for this part. The mother constantly says "I'm sorry for ruining everything Joy, I feel so stupid..." and Joy (the daugther) immediately replies:

> God! Please, we're all stupid! Small stupid humans, it's like our whole deal. For most of our history, we knew the Earth was the center of the universe. We killed and tortured people for saying otherwise. That is, until we discovered that the Earth is actually revolving around the Sun, which is just one sun out of trillions of suns. And now look at us, trying to deal with the fact that all of that exists inside of one universe out of who knows how many. Every new discovery is just a reminder: WE'RE ALL SMALL AND STUPID. And who knows which discovery comes next to make us feel like even smaller pieces of shit.

It makes me think, what is the point of life? ***Life has no fucking point***, we're mere mortals whose lives are completely irrelevant to how big the universe is and yet we constantly want to "be right", to pretend what we do matters in the long run. One day human life will cease to exist and Everything, Everywhere will just disapear All at Once. So what the fuck is the point?

I don't want to sound like a depressive person, fortunately those days are beyond me. I just really don't get it.

Changing the subject: my mom is going to die in the next few days. Boom! There. I said it. That's a really awkward thing to say when people come to me with: "Hi Arthur, how are you?", but I'm more honest than I should sometimes.

She is fighting cancer for almost an year now, last month the doctors said that it became terminal and 2 days ago she got the news: "It's probably happening in the next few days now...". She is completely lucid tho! Imagine receiving these news, being completely sane and there's nothing you can do? My mom did the opposite of what I wanted to do if it was me in her shoes. No judgement, nobody is trained for this.

One year ago, when we first got the news that she had cancer, it had an immediate impact on her. She suddendly wanted me to visit her more often, she started to notice how I'm not as close to her as she wanted to. I guess the thought "There's no certainty but I really might die from this cancer" hit her and she started to think about the past and present. I'm gonna be honest and say that she constantly wanting to come over was a pain in the ass. I have a deep affection for her, don't get me wrong, but the way I was raised did not made us super close friends. I just couldn't refuse her invites. "Come on she is your mother and she has cancer", I constantly said to myself.

A month ago, she got the news that her cancer was in the terminal stage. That was it, she's really going to die. Strangely enough, it felt like I was the only one who really heard the news. My mother and father got the news and just went like "ok, we're just going to continue the treatment our way, with prayers and hope". I was stuned, really. I was raised in a super religious family, and that made me a non-religious person. I was flabbergasted that you just got the news that you're dying and you choose to stay locked at home praying. 

> YOU'RE DYING WOMAN!
> Let's do some crazy shit, enjoy good moments with the people you love while you still can. 
> You always wanted to go to Portugal but you didn't have money, right? Well, I HAVE THAT MONEY NOW, LET'S GO WOMAN, ENJOY YOUR LIFE, I don't give a shit if I need to give up on a few things to give you this final wish...

I couldn't say any of those things, and I'm sorry, I feel like I should have offered you this trip last month when you decided to stay at home praying. It's just that I'm also not trained to the "your mom is gonna die in a month" situation :(

Two days ago she finally accepted it. She got an infection, but she has no immunity system and no platelets. If she doesn't go to surgery, the infection will spread to multiple organs since she has no immunity system. If she goes to surgery, she will bleed out to death since she doesn't have platelets in her blood. So this is it, no choice but to wait this infection spread and she finally becomes just a memory. Once everyone that remember her dies, then she becomes nothing. Just an insigificant small human amongst the imensity of the universe. Same thing will happen to me at some point, and to everyone else. Will I be prepared? Probably not, huh?

Also two days ago, we had an emotional conversation between my mom, father, brother and I. My mom was saying how she now sees how she controlled us (my brother and I) too much. She raised both of us with a lot of expectations, both sons would be super succesful professionals so she could brag about us to her sisters. We would be two handsome guys who put family as highest priority, we would marry, have 2-3 kids each. We would visit our parents constantly, like she would have done if her parents were alive when we were growing. Turns out the expectations my brother and I have for ourselves are completely different. She realizes that now... I have no idea how that happens actually, how can someone all of a sudden realize such things after almost 30 years raising us like that? One of misteries of life that I'll never know...

All this has happened, no one saw me cry yet. I was there when we received some of the inumerous bad news during this last year. I kinda got used to be the person who thinks with reason first, emotion second... I don't know how things turned out this way, I'm currently sobbing as I write this rather rational blog. I'm alone at home with my cat while my mom is at the hospital with the whole family. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to be near my uncles, aunts and older cousins in this moments. I've always felt judged while growing up, I definitely don't fit with them. As soon as they leave, I'll visit my mom. She is aware.

Back to the point of crying, I guess different people have different ways of mourning. Myself? I have a hard time crying. I guess I was taught since I was born that crying is a bad thing and that just stuck with me. I've lost people before, uncles, grandpa, grandma. I haven't cried when they were in the hospital, I haven't cried in their funerals. I do cry when I'm completely alone tho. I can't cry in front of people, unless you're super special to me.

***If I knew I was going to die in a few days, would I reflect on what I did with my life, would I regret the way I lived, would I think that I could have done things differently, would I be sorry for myself and complain to an imaginary entity that it's not fair?***

Towards my family, who is getting smaller now, I don't know... I think we could have been closer to each other. I see friends having their best time with their families, I see other friends living complete nightmares... I regret waiting so long for rebeling against the expectations that were put on me, rebeling was though on my relationship with my family at first, but living free to do whatever I want helped us getting closer as time passed. Maybe we could have become close friends if we had more time.

Towards people who've seen me cry, I do have regrets... It's funny how we often become similar to our parents, most often on aspects we try so much to avoid. Turns out that as I grew up, I often had expectations towards people close to me, or even towards myself. *"You need to go to this party, we're going to love it*", *"why aren't you enjoying this? you're so boring"*, *"don't abandon tech! you're gonna be poor!"*, *"we would be the perfect couple"*, *"why you stopped playing this game? we used to love it"*, *"arthur, you're thirty already, you should be with a girlfriend and planning your marriage already"*. Gosh, why are we like that? I hated that my parents had my life planned out for me, why do I have so many expectations for myself? Why do I have so many expectations towards people around me? Life is pointless, it doesn't make any sense expecting anything from it.

I'm still not able to 100% manage expectations towards myself, but recently I started to learn how to abandon expectations towards people around me. It might have been too late, a few special people have already decided to not maintain contact anymore. My expectations towards them was not aligned with what they wanted, and I know from experience how being put in a spot I don't want to be sucks. The big difference here is that **I'M STILL ALIVE**, I don't have a death sentence and why should I wait for it to come to change things that I don't like about my life?

That's the goal for the rest of my life, to have no expectations. I want to welcome new people and situations with an open mind, so I don't die full of regrets.

I just wish this happened sooner...

Mom, I'm sorry for expecting things from you. Just like nobody is trained to die, nobody is trained to be a parent. You did your best, I really enjoy the life I have today and I wouldn't change a single thing. All the things that happened in the past is what makes me who I am, and I'm learning to love myself. I know that if we had more time we would have become close friends. Even thought you don't see me cry, it doesn't mean this whole situation doesn't make me sad. I'm suffering in my own way, you will be missed. I wish you know that.
