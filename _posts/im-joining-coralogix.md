Before talking more about Coralogix, I feel like sharing what makes me so excited about joining the team and telling a bit about myself will probably bring some clarity.

It might sound weird to some people, but things started to work out for me when the pandemic started actually. Open-Source has always impressed me. During the pandemic, I decided to quit my previous job and learn to contribute to open-source. I was lucky to be [selected for CNCF's community bridge program](https://medium.com/@arthursens/week-00-becoming-a-mentee-on-a-cncf-project-b0d07a8ae3f), learned basically from scratch how to contribute, that is totally OK to mess up git merges, that it is OK (and desirable) to break things down into smaller PRs, that most of our time is spending communicating with others instead of coding. Basically, it was intense training in soft skills, and it was one of the best professional experiences I've ever had.

After the program ended, I was sure that I'm never working in a boring position again, I was completely sick of the thought of doing my 8h of work and counting the minutes to leave. It was already 1 year into the pandemic when I finally landed at [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), a German Startup that pioneered [Cloud development environments (CDEs)](https://www.gitpod.io/cde). I was one of the very first employees once they started hiring out of Germany, if I'm not mistaken I was number 12th or 13th employee, and I saw the company grow up to almost 70 employees in 2 years. I gotta say, seeing your work having an impact at your company and seeing a small group of nerds grow as Gitpod did, feels amazing! [2021 and 2022 were such great years for me](https://medium.com/@arthursens/cheers-to-the-future-9b8718259081) and I wouldn't wish it to be any different.

Unfortunately, this rapid growth had a big break, and [Gitpod had to lay off around 28% of its staff](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/building-for-the-long-run), and I was amongst them. The lay-off was one of the most humane I've seen during those times of crisis, we had huge support from the company, including advanced compensation, a psychological stipend, and support from recruiting partners to land a new position as soon as possible.

I saw many of my friends from Gitpod joining new companies super fast, and I got quite a few interviews right in the first weeks on unemployment. Unfortunately, all of them did not work out because either they would not hire in Brazil or I just didn't have this feeling of excitement that I felt before joining Gitpod. I was certain that I didn't want to join a company with a doubt that I was doing the right move!

During these 3 months on unemployment, I had time to spend with my mother who is battling cancer, [I lost count of how many sunsets](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq6YCU6rkfe/) I've watched, finished 3 different Final Fantasy games, and of course, [kept working at Open-Source projects I'm already involved with](https://www.arthursens.dev/posts/prometheus-agent-support). In summary, I was living the present, enjoying the moment I had and waiting until the right opportunity appeared.

## The opportunity showed up!

Open-Source is just too great and I will never understand people who don't like this type of work. Working on Prometheus-Operator, especially in adding support for Prometheus Agent, got me an interview at Coralogix:

* An Observability Platform that is built on top of open-source projects that I already contribute to.
* A startup that I know I'll have a big impact on.
* Alignment on improving upstream whenever there's an opportunity.
* A company that values knowledge sharing and encourages applying talks at tech conferences.
* Working with familiar faces that also contribute to the same projects that I do.

I'm really happy to start working on April 24th and finally join a bunch of talented colleagues üòÅ
